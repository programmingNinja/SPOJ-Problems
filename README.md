This repo contains the JAVA or C++ implementation/solution of some of the classical problems taken from http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/

The JAVA files are not independent but are in a project. So download the entire folder, import it in JAVA IDE, compile it
and run it. You will get desired output.
